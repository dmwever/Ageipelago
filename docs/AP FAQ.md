# AP FAQ

## Global

- Victory must be received at the AP Victory Pavilion, which can be researched once that mission's vanilla-equivalent task has been achieved. (UNIMPLEMENTED)
- Many triggers contain an extra condition that requires their AP item to be found. for example, Bleda's camp, normally unlocked when beating Bleda, now addiitonally requires the Bleda's Camp item. Items can be received after meeting all other conditions.

## Attila

### Attila 1: The Scourge of God

- "Attila's Camp" and "Bleda's Camp" items must be found before the player can receive their respective camp after beating/blowing off Bleda.
- Attila's Camp is not given when the player receives Bleda's Camp.
- 10 horses can be brought to the Scythian flags even if defeated or an enemy.

### Attila 2: The Great Ride

- "Attila: The Great Ride: Villagers" item must be found before the player can obtain villagers from destroying Purple's houses.
- Freeing the Tarkans location is awarded by destroying the Cyan castle or destroying the Cyan TC.
- Defeat Rome check be given without needing a TC.

### Attila 3:

- Looting no longer sends gold, but instead "AP Gold", which enables victory once 10,000 has been accumulated.
- The exception is that destroying the Red and Green Town Centers gives 3,000 gold each, but the "Red Gold" and "Green Gold" items must first be found, respectively.

### Attila 4:

- The player may build a Castle in Burugndy's base at any time for a check, even after Burgundy is defeated (UNIMPLEMENTED)

### Attila 6:

- Defeating a player also gives checks for each wonder they would have otherwise built. In theory, defeating Purple before they placed either wonder gives three checks.
